Hi! And thanks for checking me out :)

# Who am I?
In my work life I work as a systemsadministrator for Aarhus University - my daily work is based around VMware solutions and systems.

### I have experience in:
- PowerShell
- VMware: vSphere ESX and vCenter and solutions like: VSAN, NSX, Horizon
- Windows Server: AD (+LDAP), Fileservers (+DFS), WDS and more.
- Linux: Mostly a Debian based user, working with all kinds of Linux based services.
- Monitoring: Zabbix (Hereunder their agent + SNMP and more)
- Networking in general (Heavy VyOS/EdgeMAX user)

## Homelab:
I have at a very young age been looking into servers and have been a homelabber for a very long time - initially it started out as just needing a fileserver, and then it took off. Going into VMware clusters, Linux and Windows servers and services like AD/SAMBA/DFS/LDAP and more.
