# Homelab
My Homelab is based around a lot of different stuff and architectures. Trying to cramp as much compute into a 12U rack with power draw in mind. 

# Volunteering work
I have been volunteering for several things but most noteworthy is:
- NPF LAN (npf.dk). LAN party for at most 5200 people, doing networking stuff
- eSport Brande (esport-brande.dk). eSport club in Brande that trains and competes in games like CS2, Fortnite and more. I do a lot of the IT stuff for them, trying to make IT easy as we all do this for fun and don't want to spend time on IT Stuff. A lot of the work is around managing infrastructure for servers and network.
