For a while i wanted to change where my blog was placed, as i just used some expsensive webhotel as i was in need for something very reliable years years ago.

Over time the solution got more and more expensive, while my requirements went more and more down.
For web i only need static web-files now on this domain, so therefore my options was more open than ever before.

## What?

I decided due to my new job, looking into Static Web Apps from Microsoft/Azure, which i highly recommend. They have a free tier, which seems good enough for most people. It also supports Hugo in that regard that if you map it to Github it will automatically build in Git and push it to the Static Web App, when you make a change something. Without the need to write a Pipeline yourself.

So.. if some links to my page is broken, i should have fixed them all - but in case of something dont work then you can replace https://nipetersen.dk/blog/ with https://blog.nipetersen.dk/ in the URL.
